The other day, I searched my full name on Google, and none of the results on the first page were about me. That hurt my ego, so I started thinking about how to get my name to the top. My goal is to have a page from my website that talks about me appear on the first page, or maybe even as the first result.

I've been out of the SEO game for a long time, and I'm not sure what works now and what doesn't. My name, Pablo Garcia Ortega, is a long-tail keyword that I think isn't too difficult to rank for because, as far as I know, no prominent person has that name right now.

## Tools

I'm not using any tools because all the ones I used ten years ago have either disappeared or now require payment. Maybe in the future, if I can't get my name to rank, I'll consider using a trial or paying for a month, but that's not in my current plans.

## How to Do It?

I'm taking a straightforward approach. I'm creating a page that talks about me and including my name in the titles and paragraphs a few times. My secret weapon is the domain pablogarciaortega.com. I bought it a couple of years ago; it used to belong to a company that went bankrupt. I plan to point this domain to the Pablo Garcia Ortega page on my website.

## What If It Doesn't Work?

I hope that using the domain will help me rank easily on the first page, but it might not be enough. If that's the case, I'll resort to a strategy that helped me in the past: making videos on YouTube, linking to my website in the video descriptions, and embedding the videos on my page. I might even use some AI tools to help with the videos. Hopefully, I won't have to go that far.

## Conclusion

In the coming weeks, I plan to create a page and include my name in the titles, URL, and paragraphs, then point the domain pablogarciaortega.com to that page. Once that's done, I'll monitor the results in the SERPs weekly and hope to reach the first page. I'll keep you updated.
