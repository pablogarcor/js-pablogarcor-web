2024 ended various weeks ago, not a good end of year because my family caught the flu virus, but we are better now. Today is when I have found the time to stop and think about the achievements in 2024 and what do I expect from 2025.
Looking back at 2024, I think **it was a good average year**, maybe a little too stable but stability is a good thing.

## Highlights from 2024
I have achieved a couple of things that I proposed myself last year:
* **Reading more books:** I have read 12 books in 2024. 
* **Blogging:** I haven't been writing on this blog as much as I wanted. Ten posts in a year is good, but I still need to find the right topics that I'm passionate about and I enjoy writing about, I hope that 2025 brings me more inspiration. 
* **Traveling:** I went to Venetia for carnival and it was amazing. 
* **Professionally:** There weren't big changes, but at the end of the year I was stressed out with my work. All that stressful situations gave me some perspective on where I am in my career and where I want to be in the near future. 
* **I gained weight again this year:** I need to make changes ASAP because I cant continue like this. 
* **My finances are good but not outstanding:** I need to improve my savings and income if I want to buy a house, for example. 
* **My personal and family life:** This is the area where I'm most satisfied. I have a loving and healthy family and my girlfriend is the love of my life. That makes up for everything else.

## Goals for 2025
The next list of things are the ones I want to focus on this 2025:
* **Keep my family happy and healthy:** IMHO if you have a good family and friends that love you, you have almost everything you need. 
* **Improve my finances:** I want to buy a house for me and my girlfriend soon so I need the financial power to do so. 
* **Travel a little bit more than the last year:** This year begun really great because in the first month I have gone to Edinburgh. 
* **Read at least 12 books this year.** 
* **Exercise and eat healthy:** I need to put to an end this gaining weight thing. I need to focus on myself and became more fit.
* **Study more:** I need to focus on passing a few courses in college. 
* **Reduce my working hours in my full time job:** because I feel that I'm losing a lot of my time seated in front of a computer and that makes me sad. 
* **Learn a little bit of Norwegian from my girlfriend:** I've been wanting this for a couple of year, but it is hard to skip time together to study a language.

### Conclusion

Well, not much of a post but i wanted to write in paper all the things I expect from 2025 and look back at 2024 to see for what things have been done. I hope 2025 is a good year for me and for all of us.
