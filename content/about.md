## About me

I have been fascinated by technology since childhood when I began building my own gaming PCs.

In 2009, I began developing software and created a few automated bots for web scraping. Ive been an active software developer since then, I have worked on a variety of companies and startups in different projects spanning the entire software stack, from backend to frontend. Along the way, I have gained expertise in networks and operating systems. I enjoy all aspects of software development.
