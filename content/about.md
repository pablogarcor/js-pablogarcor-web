## About me

I have been fascinated by technology since childhood and started building custom PCs for gaming.

In 2009, I began developing software and created a few automated bots for web scraping.
As a freelance developer since then, I have worked on a variety of projects spanning
the entire software stack, from backend to frontend. Along the way, I have gained expertise
in networks and operating systems, allowing me to collaborate with several teams on a range of
exciting projects. I enjoy all aspects of software development and haven't yet chosen a specific
specialization.
